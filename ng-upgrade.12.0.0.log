❯ In Angular version 11, the type of `AbstractControl.parent` can be `null` to reflect the runtime value more accurately.
  This migration automatically adds non-null assertions to existing accesses of the `parent` property on types like `FormControl`, `FormArray` and `FormGroup`.
  Migration completed.

❯ ViewEncapsulation.Native has been removed as of Angular version 11.
  This migration replaces any usages with ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom.
  Migration completed.

❯ NavigationExtras omissions migration.
  In version 11, some unsupported properties were omitted from the `extras` parameter of the `Router.navigateByUrl` and `Router.createUrlTree` methods.
  Migration completed.

❯ Updates the `initialNavigation` property for `RouterModule.forRoot`.
  Migration completed.

❯ NavigationExtras.preserveQueryParams has been removed as of Angular version 11.
   This migration replaces any usages with the appropriate assignment of the queryParamsHandling key.

❯ The default value for `relativeLinkResolution` is changing from 'legacy' to 'corrected'.
This migration updates `RouterModule` configurations that use the default value to
now specifically use 'legacy' to prevent breakages when updating.
